<p align="center">A modern and simple to use discord bot application written in Python using the <b>discord.py</b> API wrapper.</p>

<p align="center">
QuBot is a python bot framework. It was built with ease of use and modularity in mind - localization, module manipulation, bot customization, etc. QuBot is open source to allow for people to self-host and maintain their own instance of the bot. It was designed to act as a base for other bot applications.
</p>

## Setup & Installation

The application was written on [Python 3.7.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-376/). While the bot's current features work on older versions of Python 3, this might not be the case in the future. Using the same python version is highly recommended.

Installation guides are available in the [QuBot Documentation](https://qubot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

**The bot has been tested and is officially supported on the following platforms:**

- [Windows](https://qubot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install-guide-windows.html)
- [Ubuntu Linux Distribution](https://qubot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install-guide-linux.html)

If you are experiencing any issues regarding the installation proccess and require further help, feel free to join the [**Discord Support Server**](https://discord.gg/TGnfsH2) and ask your question in **#help**

## Commands

A list of all [**commands**](https://qubot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commandlist.html) is available in the [QuBot Documentation](https://qubot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

You can also write ```q!help``` in one of the servers where an instance of the bot is present.

## Support Server

[**Discord Support Server**](https://discord.gg/TGnfsH2) : If you have any inquiries, suggestions, or just want to chat, feel free to join.

My intentions are to support QuBot by occasionally pushing new versions. If the opportunity arises, I would like to grow a community which creates and supports third-party modules for the bot.

## License

The bot was released under the [**MIT License**](#license)

The QuBot Framework is meant to be freely used by anyone who is interested in running their own instance of the bot.

To anyone who is interested in contributing to the git repository, feel free to contact me.
