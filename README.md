<p align="center">A modern and simple to use discord bot application written in Python using the <b>discord.py</b> API wrapper.</p>

<p align="center">
The bot is still in early development. It has been created in occasion of Discord's Hack Week. Nevertheless, I have plans to continue development after the event.
</p>

## Setup & Installation

The application has been written in [Python 3.7.3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-373/). While the bot's current features work on older versions of Python 3, this might not be the case in the future.

After you are done installing python, either use git clone or directly download using the GitHub platform.

The bot has been written on and for Windows machines. Keep in mind that the uploaded virtual environment is obsolete on Linux machines. If you wish to run it on Linux, you'll have to create a new virtual environment and install all needed packages. You can find the requirements.txt file in 'QBEnv/Scripts/requirements.txt'. The virtual environment will be deleted from the repository in the future and both tutorials for Windows and Linux users will be published. Until then, you'll have to figure it out and manually do it.

### * *On Windows*

> To easily launch the bot on Windows, you could create a batch file in the main directory. Give it a name and write this in the file:
```
@echo off
QBEnv\Scripts\python.exe main.py %*
pause
```
### * *On Linux*

> To be added in the future

## Commands

Currently, you'll have to use ```.help``` . The documentation is in WIP and will be linked here **ASAP**
